### Version 2

## Summary
Version 2 adds a few new features and cleans up code a bit.  The game is still
pretty boring though, with no user input. These characters are getting hard to
extend and manage.  I wonder if there is a better way...

## Changelog

#### Version 2
* adds max health for entities
* adds generic attack function
* adds experience and basic level up functionality
* adds multiple fights until hero dies
